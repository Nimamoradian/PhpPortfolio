Hello Everyone

This is a portfolio of a computer languages learning web site that I made.
I tried to use different elements and techniques. 
In order to create it I used : PHP, Javscript , MySql, Xampp, HTML , CSS, Bootstrap.

The Idea of the pages is that if someone connected then can see some new features (such as profile page which is hidden before log in).

in the Sql we have to tables for users information and courses but for each courses I need a table for each lecture.
Also I want to have another tables that shows which course/courses has been choosen by each user.
I am trying to add more thing and cleaning the code ASAP
